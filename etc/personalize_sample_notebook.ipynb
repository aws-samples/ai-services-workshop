This file is known in Amazon Personalize as an **Interactions** data file.  Other data files are usable, such as ones that define additional metadata about the movies (such as year and genre) and another that defines demographic data about the user (such as age, gender and location).

You can also compare results across multiple different algorithm recipes, helping you choose the best performing one for you particular dataset.\n",
