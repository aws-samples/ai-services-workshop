## Overview

Amazon Personalize is a machine learning service that makes it easy for developers to create individualized recommendations for customers using their applications.

Machine learning is being increasingly used to improve customer engagement by powering personalized product and content recommendations, tailored search results, and targeted marketing promotions. However, developing the machine-learning capabilities necessary to produce these sophisticated recommendation systems has been beyond the reach of most organizations today due to the complexity of developing machine learning functionality. Amazon Personalize allows developers with no prior machine learning experience to easily build sophisticated personalization capabilities into their applications, using machine learning technology perfected from years of use on Amazon.com.

This lab will walk you through the following:

- Deploy and configure a *Video Recommendation* application
- Setting up a Jupyter Notebook environment for the Amazon Personalize Service Preview
- Downloading and preparing training data, based on the Movie Lens data set
- Importing prepared data into Amazon Personalize
- Building an ML model based upon the Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network algorithm (HRNN)
- Testing your model by deploying an Amazon Personalize campaign
- Adding your campaign to Video Recommendation application
