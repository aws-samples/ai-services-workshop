Upon completion of this lab you will have performed the following:

- Launched a Jupyter notebook from with the Amazon SageMaker service
- Imported external files into the notebook environment
- Seen how to enable Preview services within a notebook (assuming your account has been whitelisted for Preview access)
- Used the `pandas` libraries to do some pre-processing of the source data
- Built and deployed an ML model based upon the HRNN algorithm
- Tested your model via just a few lines of code
- Deployed your model into a live application

You should now be able to embed this model from within your own application code, using any language that is supported by the AWS SDK.  Happy recommending!
